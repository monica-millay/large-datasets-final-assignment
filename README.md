<h1>Self-Employed Workers & Poverty</h1>

This repository contains the Stata code used in my final assignment for the course Using Large Datasets in Policy Research.

The project analyzes the difference in poverty rates between New York City residents who are self-employed versus wage workers using data from the 2023 Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS).  

The code first cleans the data and narrows down the dataset to include just self-employed and wage workers. 

After determining that <strong>the poverty rate among self-employed New Yorkers is 12.1%, compared to 5.7% for wage workers</strong>, I explore the data to try to explain why this dramatic difference exists.

I argue that self-employed workersâ€™ increased likelihood of being part-time is driving their higher rates of poverty and create graphs to illustrate this point.

I obtained the 2023 ASEC to the CPS data from <a href="https://cps.ipums.org/cps/index.shtml" target="_blank">IPUMS</a>. Note The income and employment based are on the previous year, or March 1, 2022 through February 28, 2023.
