<h1>Final Assignent for Using Large Datasets in Policy Research</h1>

This repository contains the Stata code used in my final assignment for the course Using Large Datasets in Policy Research.

The project analyzes the difference in poverty rates between New York City residents who are self-employed versus wage workers using data from the 2023 Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS).  

The code first cleans the dataset and narrows it down to include just workers who are self-emplpoyed and wage workers. 

After determining that the poverty rate among self-employed New Yorkers is 12.1%, compared to 5.7% for wage workers, I explore the data to try to explain why dramatic difference exists.

I argue that self-employed workersâ€™ increased likelihood of being part-time is driving their higher rates of poverty and create several graphs to illustrate this point.
